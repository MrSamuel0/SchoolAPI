# SchoolAPI

**SchoolAPI** is my first ASP.NET Core Web API project.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **.NET** and **ASP.NET Core**
- **Entity Framework Core** with **Pomelo MySQL provider**
- **EF Core Tools** for database management using **Migrations**
- **MySQL** as the database engine
- No frontend – interaction is handled entirely through **Swagger UI**

## 🏫 Project Context

The application represents a basic school system. It includes the following entities:

- **Teachers** – Partially implemented (relation with students still pending)
- **Students** – Almost complete
- **SchoolReport** and **SchoolSubjects** – Currently support only `POST` actions; remaining CRUD operations are under development
