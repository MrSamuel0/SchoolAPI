# SchoolAPI

My first ASP.NET API, the api stack is .NET, ASP.NET, Pomelo EF core MySql, EF core, EF core tools, used Migrations to create the MySql database, No frontend, just using the SwaggerUi

The context is: a school, you have Teachers (not completly developed all functions, like the relation between teacher and student), Students (almost complete), SchoolReport and SchoolSubjects (theese two not completly developed, just the "post" actions).
